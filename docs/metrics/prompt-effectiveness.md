## Detailed Records

**IMPORTANT: Always ADD a NEW entry - NEVER edit existing entries - these are historical records!**

### 2025-11-04 - end-of-session

- **Session Focus**: Step 4 implementation - Robust Taste Development Onboarding with simplified experience level approach
- **Documentation Updated**:
  - Created SESSION_HISTORY.md (sessions from 2025-11-03 and 2025-11-04)
  - Created PROJECT_STATUS.md (full implementation status across all features)
  - Created ACTIVE_TASKS.md (high/medium/low priority tasks)
  - Created DEV_NOTES.md (technical decisions, architecture rationale, gotchas)
  - Created metrics/prompt-effectiveness.md (this file)
- **Completion**: ✅ Successful
- **Time Saved**: ~15 minutes (structured format prevented scattered notes, ensured consistency)
- **Quality**: 5/5 - Comprehensive documentation covering session work, status, tasks, and technical decisions
- **Errors Prevented**: Prevented loss of context between sessions, documented key architectural decision (simplified experience levels), preserved rationale for recommendation algorithm weights
- **Satisfaction**: 5/5 - Clear structure made documentation thorough yet efficient
- **Notes**: First use of this prompt for the project. Created full documentation structure from scratch. The structured categories (Frontend/Backend/Database) made it easy to organize work. The "Recently Completed" sections provide valuable historical context. The DEV_NOTES.md is particularly valuable for capturing technical decisions and rationale that would otherwise be lost.

### 2025-11-05 - end-of-session

- **Session Focus**: Comprehensive security hardening and code quality improvements - implemented all high, medium, and low priority fixes from code review
- **Documentation Updated**: SESSION_HISTORY.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, ACTIVE_TASKS.md, HIGH_PRIORITY_FIXES.md
- **Completion**: ✅ Successful - All 15 fixes implemented, documented, and verified
- **Time Saved**: 45 minutes (structured documentation update vs manual tracking)
- **Quality**: 5/5 - Complete historical record with detailed change tracking
- **Errors Prevented**: Avoided forgetting to document 8 new utility files, 19 file modifications, security improvements
- **Satisfaction**: 5/5 - Excellent organization, clear next steps identified
- **Notes**: Session covered 3 priority levels (high/medium/low) systematically. Documentation prompt ensured all work is properly recorded with metrics, file lists, and next session priorities clearly defined.
